# Wikipedia and NYT API
This app pulls information from the Wikipedia and New York Times API based on the word(s) that the user inputs. This includes article titles and urls..

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery

when the user puts in an input in the field and searches the apis of New York Times and Wikipedia.

## Optimizations:

Potentially add more css components.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first independent attempt at a complex api as such I built my ability to work with apis independently.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:

**Javascript To Do List:** https://github.com/mardelvalle/Javascript-To-Do-List

**Harvard Museum:** https://github.com/mardelvalle/Harvard-Museum
